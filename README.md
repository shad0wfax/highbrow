# Highbrow - Simple framework for capturing high resolution information from modern browsers

Highbrow is a javascript framework providing many ways of  capturing "High Resolution" infromation from a web page from the end user.
It is a collection of tools to let your users send information interactively.

Highbrow is built by  Highres.IO

## Getting started
* Create new project via executing `brunch new <project name>`.
Brunch with chaplin is a default application skeleton for Brunch,
so you don't need to specify `--skeleton` option for the command.
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w`.
* Open the `public/` dir to see the result.
* Write your code.

Example application built with the skeleton:
[Ost.io](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio).

See [Chaplin site](http://chaplinjs.org) for docs and more info.
